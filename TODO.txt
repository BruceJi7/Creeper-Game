TODO:

- Clean up menu - put the two unit menus together on screen, and add a submit button

- Make images load from a dict

- Add random options: random from one book, one series, all together

- Add exit to go back to book / unit selection

THEN the game is complete.

Creeper Game now has functional unit selection menu. The game maintains the same units until it is exited.
Things to improve include:

- in the game over screen, a highlight box persists. Clear it.

- Add a counter for how many creepers are remaining.

- Make the unit labels look a bit nicer.
