The tasks to make the 'menu' version function are as follows:

- Create a 'intro page' function that draws a menu from where we can select different books and units.

- Modify game over screen so that clicking on the screen can exit it:
	- On click, return from the game over function


- Remove the game state variable in favour of a game function that contains a loop.
	- If the players win, return from the 'main' function, move onto 'game over' function
