# Creeper-Game
Creeper Game as used at work. Educational Purposes!

---

The Creeper Game is a minecraft-themed game that also uses materials from the Neung Yule Come On series of books.
It is a TEFL game for two teams.

There is a 4x4 grid of pictures in the middle of the screen.
Each team builds a house on their side of the board by finding blocks.
Students call out the picture in the grid that they can see, and the teacher clicks it.
Clicking the picture reveals either a block or a creeper head.
If the student finds a block, part of the house is built on their side of the screen.
If the student finds a creeper, an explosion happens and the house is gone.

There are 4 creepers randomly placed in the game.

Good luck.
